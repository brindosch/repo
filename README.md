Mookfist Kodi Repository
========================


To install:

Download https://github.com/mookfist/repo/raw/master/zips/repository.mookfist.zip

Goto your Addons screen in Kodi, check Install From Zip, and select the zip file you downloaded. Now you can install my various plugins.

What's available:

QBittorrent - A plugin to monitor and control QBittorrent
python-requests - A plugin to add the great requests python library for use with other plugins

Stuff I want:

Add files to Movies to TV Shows - I envision this plugin to allow me to select a file, select whether it's a movie or a tv show, and have the file copied to any source folder that can accomodate it.
